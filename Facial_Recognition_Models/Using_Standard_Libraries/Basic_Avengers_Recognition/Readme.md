## Face-Recognition

This is a simple facial recognition and classification project where facerecognition model is used to predict the face and label the image.The model is trained with some images present in the data_img folder and encodes all the faces . Then the model asks the user for  input image which is passed through the find_target method where will find all of the faces in a given image and label them if it knows what they are. Face locations are encoded and compared with both the train and test image. If both are equal it classify the image along with the label.
